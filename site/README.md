# PhyloPrep Browser Edition

This directory is a buildless static site designed for GitHub Pages. It uses
Pyodide to run the repository's original selected Python scripts locally in a
visitor's browser; no FASTA content is posted to a server by this page.

## Deploy with GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to a GitHub repository you control.
2. Open **Settings → Pages** and select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
3. Push to `main`, or use **Actions → Deploy PhyloPrep Browser Edition → Run workflow**.

The included workflow generates `site/engine/` from the original source files,
then uploads `site/`. For a local preview, run `node site/build-engine.mjs`
from the repository root before starting an HTTP server for `site/`.

The browser edition runs the listed standalone preparation modules through the
same original scripts used by the CLI, including quality control,
back-translation, four-fold-site tools, 4DTV, supermatrix construction,
filtering, renaming, trimming, and conversion. It does not replace the full
batch workflow or external aligners such as MAFFT, trimAl, and MACSE.
